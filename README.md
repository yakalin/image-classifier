# Image Classifier

This is a Convolutional Neural Network developed to classify the images given in the folder _input_data_. To add more pictures, just add a folder with the class name (so for car images the folder should have the name car) and edit the line given in ___. Make sure that there are roughly the same amount of images for every category. For larger data, I suggest training longer. You can do this by increasing the epochs in the code. Have fun!
